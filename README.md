# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-python
A python program for handwritten digit recognition.

Programming language used:  
Python using scikit learn module. 

Problem type: 
Classification based problem. 

Classifier used: 
Decision Tree Classifier. 

Dataset: 
“Keggle” site used as a source for dataset.
Total: 42000 records of pixels of different images of handwritten digits(0-9). 
Training set consists of first 50% records. 
Image of a single hand written digit is passed as input.

Source code in the file named "Minor.py" of this repository.

Outputs:
The input image is coverted to a row of pixels, which is stored in the excel sheet "array.csv", this is now converted into a 28*28 pixel image.
